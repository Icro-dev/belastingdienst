## Containers 101

Your team decides that everybody is ready to start implementing containers. Your team decides to follow a course to learn how to use containers, therefore everybody takes the "Containers 101" course, it mainly consists of two parts:

- **Run a container.** You will learn how to pull images from the Docker Hub public registry.
- **Build a node image.** You will learn how to build a new container image and run a container with the new created image.

### Run a container

```bash
# Pull the nginx image
docker pull nginx

# Run the nginx image
docker run -p 80 nginx

# In another tab/terminal check the running containers
docker ps

# In another tab/terminal check the running containers
docker logs CONTAINER_ID

# Now, stop the current running container
docker stop CONTAINER_ID

# List all containers (also stopped)
docker ps -a

# Remove the container
docker rm CONTAINER_ID
```

### Build a node image

```bash
# Create a dir in ~/docker/build-image and acces it
mkdir -p ~/docker/build-image
cd $_

# Create package.json file
cat <<EOF >> package.json
{
  "name": "docker_web_app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Node.js on Docker",
  "author": "First Last <first.last@example.com>",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
EOF

# Create the nodejs script
cat <<EOF >> server.js
'use strict';
 
const express = require('express');
 
// Constants
const PORT = 8080;
const HOST = '0.0.0.0';
 
// App
const app = express();
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World');
});
 
app.listen(PORT, HOST, () => {
  console.log(`Running on http://${HOST}:${PORT}`);
});
EOF

# Create the Dockerfile file
cat <<EOF >> Dockerfile
FROM node:18
# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
# Install app dependencies
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# where available (npm@5+)
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
# If you are building your code for production
# RUN npm ci --omit=dev
# Bundle app source
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]
EOF

# Create the .dockerignore file
cat <<EOF >> .dockerignore
node_modules
npm-debug.log
EOF

# Build the image
docker build . -t nodeapp

# List images in local machine
docker images

# Run the new image
docker run -p 8080:8080 -d nodeapp

# In another tab/terminal check the status of the container
docker ps

# Test the application
curl localhost:8080

# Stop the container
docker stop ID_CONTAINER

# Remove the container
docker rm ID_CONTAINER
```

### Use docker compose files

```bash
# Create the docker-compose file
cat <<EOF >> docker-compose.yaml
services:
  notes:
    build:
      context: .
  ports:
  - 8080:8080
EOF

# Build the image
docker-compose build

# Startup the containers
docker-compose up

# From another tab/terminal check the status
docker-compose ps

# Stop the containers
docker-compose stop

# Run the containers in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# Check the logs
docker-compose logs

# Follow the logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

## Containerize the python application

Your team is glad that you took the course "Containers 101". As next step they ask you to containerize the python web application to share and run.

**Objectives:**

1. Create a new container image and test it with the `docker run command`. Don't forget to use a non-root user to run the application.
2. Create an account in the docker registry.
3. Login to the docker registry and push the new image to that registry.
4. Pull the image of another team member to your local computer and run the container.
6. Enhance the `Readme.md` documentation file to explain how to build the image and how to run it locally.

## Move this to docker-compose

Your team is pleased by your container, but they like to work with Infrastructure as Code and they ask you to please create a docker compose file for your python application.

**Objectives:**

1. Create the docker compose file for the python webapp.
2. Enhance the `Readme.md` documentation file to show how to use the application with docker compose.

## Update the systemd service to use containers

Your team is now convinced that your container is working, well documented and tested. Now it is time to upgrade the systemd configuration to replace it with the working container.

**Objectives:**

1. Update the systemd unit configuration file of the webapp service to use the docker compose file to startup the service.



## Containers 102

Now it is time to take the second half of the course about containers. Your team also wants to learn how to manage networking and storage in containers.

In this second half is about these two topics:

- **Connect two containers.** In many cases, containers need to interact with each other. 
- **Manage volumes.**
