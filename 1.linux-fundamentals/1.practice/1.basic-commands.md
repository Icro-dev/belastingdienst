1. Create the following directory and access to it `/tmp/commands/`

2. Create the following directory structure in the directory `/tmp/commands/`:

```
.
├── app
│   ├── backend
│   └── frontend
├── configs

```

3. Create a file in the directory `app/configs` called `prod.conf`.

        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_param QUERY_STRING    $query_string;
    }

    location ~ \.(gif|jpg|png)$ {
        root /data/images;
    }
}
```
