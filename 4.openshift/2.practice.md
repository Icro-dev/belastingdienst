## Run a nodeapp using configmaps as sourcecode

This time, we will make use of configmaps as volumes in deployments.

Try to make use of the OC CLI to generate the manifest files to then later create the resources by using the command `oc apply`. Tip: you can make use of the flags `--dry-run=server` and `-o=yaml` to show the resulting manifest file without creating the resource.

**Objectives:**

Create the code to:

- Create a new configmap called `node-source-code` with two keys:
    - `package.json` as the name of the key. The value should be the contents of this file https://github.com/musghost/belastingdienst/blob/main/sources/node-app/package.json
    - `server.js` as the name of the key. The value should be the contents of this file https://github.com/musghost/belastingdienst/blob/main/sources/node-app/server.js
    - You can make use of the examples listed here to create the configmap using the CLI https://jamesdefabia.github.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl_create_configmap/
- Create a new Deployment with the following specifications:
    - Use the image `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/nodejs-16`
    - Mount the configmap as Volume in the path `/var/node-source/`. Check how to do it here https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#populate-a-volume-with-data-stored-in-a-configmap
    - Set the working directory as `/var/node-source/`
    - Add a multiline command to run the nodeapp with the following commands:
        - `npm install`
        - `node server.js`
    - Configure the container port as `8080`.
- Create a new Service to expose the Deployment in the Cluster
- Create a new Route to expose the Service outside the Cluster
- Group these configuration files in a kustomization file.

## Generate the BuildConfig and Imagestream to run the node application

The entrypoint is nice but npm packages should be already present in the container image. To do that we will generate a new container image by using a BuildConfig.

Generate a new container image for the node application using the source code in the path `sources/node-app`.

**Objectives:**

- Create a new ImageStream called `node-app`.
- Create a new BuildConfig with the following specs:
    - The git source is the repo https://github.com/musghost/belastingdienst/
    - The output should be the new created ImageStream 
- Test if the image works by running a deployment that uses the generated image. You might need this guide to achieve it https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/openshift_images/using-imagestreams-with-kube-resources.html
- Enable triggering automatically a new updated deployment for changes on the imagestream. You might need this guide https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/openshift_images/triggering-updates-on-imagestream-changes.html

## Create a new database

**Objectives:**

- Create a new deployment with the following specs:
    - 1 replica
    - Use the image registry.redhat.io/rhscl/postgresql-95-rhel7
    - Set the following environment variables:
        - POSTGRESQL_USER as someuser
        - POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD as somepwd
        - POSTGRESQL_DATABASE as mydb
    - Expose the port 5432
    - Add an emptyDir volume in /var/lib/pgsql/data
        - https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir-configuration-example
- Access to the pod/container via terminal and create a new table and add some records to it
- Expose the deployment with a service
- Run a pod in the same namespace with the same image with the following spec:
    - command as sleep 3600
    - Access to the database from this pod with psql command, use name of the service as hostname of the database
- Create a new cronjob to dump the database to an emptyDir
    - The cronjob should run every 5 min
    - The cronjob should run in the same namespace
